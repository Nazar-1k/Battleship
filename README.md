# About this game

This is a very interesting idea for a game, but with my ideas (I wanted to implement a manual arrangement of cells, but after doing a certain part I realized that the arrangement options only increase (too huge scales and probably not even 100,000 lines will be enough to describe it) and I came to conclusion that ideally I will not make this game) therefore, I postponed this game for an indefinite term, let's tell and show what I implemented at this stage:

We have a simple menu with buttons (to start the game, information "which is not there", and to exit the game) and two fields for the player and the enemy.
